# Data_Mining_Assignments

My Assignemnts for Data Mining course at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
They are in Python language.
1: calculate Mean vector and total variance,  Covariance matrix (inner and outer product form), Correlation matrix as pair-wise cosines and Dominant Eigenvector
2:  Linear Regression : Q-r factorisation with ridge
3: Logistic regression and kernal logsitic regression.
4: Neural Network: implementation  of MLP algorithm
5: Dual SVM training based on SGA algorithm
6: Expectation-Maximization Clustering algorithma and calculate purity score.
