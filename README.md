# Data_Mining_Assignments

## My Assignemnts for Data Mining course at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
They are in Python language. <br />
1: calculate Mean vector and total variance,  Covariance matrix (inner and outer product form), Correlation matrix as pair-wise cosines and Dominant Eigenvector <br />
2:  Linear Regression : Q-r factorisation with ridge. <br />
3: Logistic regression and kernal logsitic regression. <br />
4: Neural Network: implementation  of MLP algorithm. <br />
5: Dual SVM training based on SGA algorithm. <br />
6: Expectation-Maximization Clustering algorithma and calculate purity score. <br />
